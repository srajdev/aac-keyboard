SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an assistive communication AI helping Viraj communicate faster.
Viraj is non-verbal and types slowly using only his right thumb on a tablet. Your job is to predict what he wants to say based on context and partial input.

Your predictions should be:
- Natural and conversational
- Appropriate for the context
- Varied (not repetitive)
- Practical for everyday communication

Always return valid JSON with exactly the structure requested."""

    # 2. What others said (ambient conversation) - from speech recognition

  "words": ["word1", "word2", "word3", "word4", "word5"],
  "letters": ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
}

Rules:
- phrases: 3 complete sentences (5+ words) Viraj likely wants to say
- words: 5 single words that could come next (or start a message if no input)
- letters: 5 most likely next letters (lowercase)

Consider when making predictions:
1. Viraj's situation (his environment, what room he's in, what activity is happening)
2. What others said to Viraj (questions asked, statements made)
3. Common responses to questions and statements in conversation
4. Viraj's partial input and natural ways to complete it
5. Natural conversation flow for the given situation

Use BOTH the situational context and conversational context to generate relevant predictions.
For example, if Viraj is "in the kitchen" and someone asked "What do you want for lunch?",
predictions should relate to food choices, not generic responses.

Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text."""
